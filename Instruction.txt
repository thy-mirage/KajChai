As you can see from the image that in the quick actions If I click on any part of the card then it is getting redirected to the correct page. But I want that this redirection shopuld only happen if someone clicks on the view button. fix this issue.
In the same image you can see that pofile picture, name of the customer is getting cut in the navbar. Fix that also
