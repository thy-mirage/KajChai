Now in the worker end, In thye recent activity portion I want to replcae it with the reminders and here we will show the number of unread notifications that we have also shown for the cuomer, it would be shoown here in the same way for the worker and then we wil give reminder of number of unread chats similarly as we have done for the customer, you have to just do it in the same way for the worker and then we will show the worker the number of booked work and emphasize him to complete the work.

UI Idea (Worker Reminder Card)

Reminders

ðŸ’¬ 4 unread chat messages

ðŸ”” 3 unread notifications

ðŸ“Œ 2 booked works pending completion

If all clear:

Reminders

âœ… No unread messages

âœ… No new notifications

âœ… All booked works are completed

In the navbar as we are showing unread notification count in the notification option similarly we can show the unread chat count in the mnessages option in the same way. I've given you the image for this reference

you just need to follow how the customer end it has been implemented. keep in mind the translations
