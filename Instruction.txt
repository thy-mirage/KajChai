Now we need to add another hthin g that is:
When a customer is marking a hirepost as completed and inputgting the payment amount then after that a notification to the worker will be sent that his work of this has been completed and the customer xyz payed this amount.


Now you just need to add the notification mechanism in this process and rest is already implemented
