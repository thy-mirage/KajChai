Now in the admin end, in forum complaints as you can see from the image still mock data is being shown in the total complaints, resolved and rejected. We need to show the reald ata fetched from the db. You can get the information very easily from the forum_complaints table's status field. 
Implement it and also as the data fetching takes time from db you can add loading transition as you have applied for the customer and worker for the same cause.

If you want to run frontend and backend you just have to use the following cmnd:
relative path then ; then ./mvnw spring-boot:run
